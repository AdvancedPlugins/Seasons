# Temperature configuration, in Celsius
# Player's temperature depends on base environment temperature, biome temperature, season, light level at location and
# number of armor items player is wearing. All of this is fully configurable below.

# Per-biome temperature is configurable in `biomeConfiguration` folder files
base: 18

# Temperature Formula
# %base% = base temperature (see setting above)
# %biome% = relative biome temperature based
# %seasonTemp% = season temperature (see settings below)
# %lightLevel% = light level at that location (can be increased by e.g. torches, lava etc), range: 0-15
# %armorItemsCount% = how many armor items player has equipped
# %conditionalTemp% = based on conditions (e.g. player is in shade; night; raining; in water etc.)
temperatureFormula: "%base% + %biome% + %seasonTemp% + (%lightLevel%) + (%armorItemsCount% *2) + %conditionalTemp%"

# Relative to base, higher or lower +/- celcius
temperature:
  SPRING: 2
  SUMMER: 7
  FALL: -2
  WINTER: -25

# Custom biomes without winter
# These biomes will calculate "winter" season temperature with formula: (fall+spring)/2
noWinterBiomes:
  - 'badlands_deserts'
  - 'savannas_hills'
  - 'jungles'

# Are temperature events enabled?
temperatureEventsEnabled: true

# Configurable temperature events
# Effects are based on Abilities - https://wiki.advancedplugins.net/abilities/introduction
# You can pretty much use any combination of effects from here https://wiki.advancedplugins.net/abilities/effects
# Temperature events are handled and added every 20 ticks (1 second)
